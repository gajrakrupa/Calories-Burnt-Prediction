#🏋️‍♀️ Calories Burnt Prediction System
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the number of calories burned based on user biometrics and activity data using a machine learning regression model. It demonstrates the use of Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

🎯 Objective

To estimate calories burned from physical activity data and help users understand how different factors like duration, heart rate, and body parameters affect calorie consumption.

🧠 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

Tools: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook

⚙️ Key Steps in the Project

Data Collection & Exploration – Loaded and explored activity and calorie datasets.

Data Cleaning & Merging – Handled missing values and merged datasets on user ID.

Feature Engineering – Selected key features influencing calorie burn.

Model Building – Trained a regression model using Linear Regression.

Model Evaluation – Compared predicted vs. actual values and measured accuracy.

📊 Results & Insights

The regression model achieved good predictive accuracy for calorie estimation.

Identified that activity duration and heart rate are major influencers of calorie burn.

Can be extended for fitness apps or personalized health tracking systems.

🚀 Future Scope

Integrate real-time fitness data from smart devices.

Apply deep learning models for improved prediction accuracy.

Deploy as a web app for user-friendly calorie estimation.
