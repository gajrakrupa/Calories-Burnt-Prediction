# 🏋️‍♀️ Calories Burnt Prediction System  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts the number of calories burned based on user biometrics and activity data using a **machine learning regression model**.  
It demonstrates the use of **Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn** for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  

## 🎯 Objective  
To estimate calories burned from physical activity data and help users understand how different factors like duration, heart rate, and body parameters affect calorie consumption.  

## 🧠 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- **Tools:** Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook  

## ⚙️ Key Steps in the Project  
1. **Data Collection & Exploration** – Loaded and explored activity and calorie datasets.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Merging** – Handled missing values and merged datasets on user ID.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Selected key features influencing calorie burn.  
4. **Model Building** – Trained a regression model using Linear Regression.  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Compared predicted vs. actual values and measured accuracy.  

## 📊 Results & Insights  
- The regression model achieved good predictive accuracy for calorie estimation.  
- Identified that activity duration and heart rate are major influencers of calorie burn.  
- Can be extended for **fitness apps** or **personalized health tracking** systems.  

## 🚀 Future Scope  
- Integrate real-time fitness data from smart devices.  
- Apply deep learning models for improved prediction accuracy.  
- Deploy as a web app for user-friendly calorie estimation.
